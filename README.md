Clean and Reproducible Code - a short workshop

Often overlooked but tremendously important: clean and reproducible code is the basis for any type of computational work, no matter if in academia or industry. But what does this actually refer to, what does it entail and what tools can be used to make it easier/ensure quality?

In this short workshop, we will explore the respective basis, including:

- [Code formatting, styling and linting]()
- [Code testing]()
- [Continuous integration]()

These topics will be explored based on examples, both provided by the lecturers and brought by the participants. 

All materials are published as a [JupyterBook](https://KamitaniLab.gitlab.io/Clean_Reproducible_Code).
